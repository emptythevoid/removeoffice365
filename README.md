A super simple batch script and XML configuration files to remove the pre-installed languages (en-us, es-es, fr-fr) of Microsoft Office 365 Click To Run.

I made this because these three items have to be removed in order to install Office 2019 using ODT.

This procedure requires installing the Office Deployment Tool (ODT).  It can be found here:

Usage:
Once ODT is installed in the proper location, place the batch file and the three XML files inside the ODT directory.  Then run the batch file and wait.
